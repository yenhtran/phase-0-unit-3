### Reflection
## I enjoyed this week's topic on SQL. I enjoyed the SQ tutorials and thought the tutorial was pretty good dispite the bugs. Unfortunately I didn't have time to go back and redo the quizes. I like data so understanding how to maintain databases in organized tables is of interest to me.
