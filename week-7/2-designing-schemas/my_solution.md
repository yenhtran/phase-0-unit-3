## Release 5: Reflection
I've had experience scraping the surface of Microsoft Access before so I had SOME familiarity with schemas and queries. However, there was still a ton of stuff that I didn't know. I learned what Primary/Foreign keys do, but do need to practice them. Patrick and I had some confusion on how to actually use them in the SQL Designer, but we think we got it right. (I.e. We weren't sure if the color of the connector had any significance.)
