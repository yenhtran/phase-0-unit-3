I enjoyed this challenge. I believe I enjoy SQL the most. I'm learning that I like to organize things and SQL is right up my alley! I was able to create and insert data and it was incredibly gratifying when it worked. I learned how to Join (Inner) my tables and it was great to know that it worked!

A trick I also learned that it helps to write out the code in the text editor and then paste it into the terminal. This way, you don't have to re-enter the data when you make a mistake!
